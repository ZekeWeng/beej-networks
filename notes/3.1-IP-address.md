# 3.1 IP Addresses

## IPv4
- 4 bytes (32 bits) → 2^32 addresses
- Example: 192.168.1.1

## IPv6
- 16 bytes (128 bits) → 2^128 addresses
- Example: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
- Compression of 0s:
  - Leading zeros in groups
  - Groups of zeros
  - Trailing zeros

## Loopback Addresses
- IPv4: 127.0.0.1
- IPv6: ::1

## IPv4/IPv6 Compatibility
- IPv4 addresses can be mapped to IPv6
- Example: 192.0.2.33 → ::ff:192.0.2.33

## Subnets
- Format: [Network:Host]
- Network/Host allocation affects network capacity
- More host bits = more devices in network

### Network Masks
- Format: Ones followed by Zeros
- Used with bitwise AND operation on IP address
- Examples:
  - IPv4: 192.0.2.12/30 (30 bits for network)
  - IPv6: 2001:db8::/32 (32 bits for network)

## Port Numbers
- 16 bits → 2^16 possible ports per address
- Analogy: "IP Address is the Street of the Hotel, Port is the Room"
- Ports ≤ 1024 are special OS-reserved ports
