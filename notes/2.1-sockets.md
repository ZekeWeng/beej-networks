# 2.1 Two Types of Internet Sockets

## Overview
Sockets are a way of speaking/interacting with programs outside of standard I/O. They provide two-way streams (queue-ordered).

## Types of Sockets

### Stream Sockets
- Used for:
  - Telnet: Remote terminal access
  - SSH: Secure remote terminal access
  - HTTP: Web browsing and API communication

### Datagram Sockets
- Used for:
  - TFTP: Simple file transfer
  - DHCP: Dynamic IP address assignment
  - Multiplayer games: Real-time game state updates
  - Video streaming: Live video transmission
  - Audio streaming: Live audio transmission

## Key Protocols

### Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) [Stream Socket]
- Ensures data arrives error-free
- Provides reliable delivery
- Used when data integrity is crucial

### Internet Protocol (IP) [Stream Socket]
- Handles routing of data packets
- Foundation of internet communication

### User Datagram Protocol (UDP) [Datagram Socket]
- Connectionless protocol
- No need for connection establishment
- Faster transmission
- Used when speed is prioritized over reliability

## Protocol Selection Guide
**Question**: How reliable/fast do I need the data?

**Answer**:
- Unreliable Stream â†’ FASTER, SPEED, correction algorithms
- Use when speed is more important than guaranteed delivery
